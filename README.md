# TODO-LIST
This is a software-engineering project, lead by Dr. Ross from SCIS.   The idea is to create an intelligent to-do list application with optimization in mind. For example, say someone needs to go to the pharmacy (CVS), dry-cleaning, groceries, and other items. What would be the best approach to accomplish this. Could the application provide a suggested order given additional information.  Think of it as a Waze app for tasks/location/to-do's/honey-do's.   Another use of this application could be that you are visiting another city. Maybe you were sent to do some work by your company. You still need to accomplish a few items to do. You have limited amount of time. How can this application optimizae your to-do list. Should it consider traffic? etc.   Given this is the first semester for this Project, Dr. Ross will like to have a limited amount of students and there may be a selection process to it.
